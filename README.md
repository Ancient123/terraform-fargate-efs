# Terraform for AWS ECS Fargate + EFS Mounts

## Why?
I have written this same boilerplate for basically every employer I have worked for in recent memory.

I decided to write this version on personal time so I can "steal" it when I inevitably have to write the same thing for a new employer again instead of writing from scratch.

Maybe it can help some other people as well.

## Notes
You will need to put an index.html in the EFS share *somehow* before the nginx container will start correctly.
